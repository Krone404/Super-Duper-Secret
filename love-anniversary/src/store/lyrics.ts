"I can't believe how happy I am
I think I was embarrassing with them, wasn't I?
So does that mean you didn't really like all the champagne?
No, I did. Too much"

My love's on the silver screen
She's always playing make-believe
And she's got emerald eyes
That let me know just what she needs

It's hard to show
Exactly what she means to me
I'll give my world
A girl like that don't come for free

Oh, darling, won't you believe me?
I love you 'til the record stops, the record stops
Oh, darling, won't you believe me?
I love you 'til the record stops, the record stops
Oh, darling, darling
Now darling, darling
Darling, darling
I love you 'til the record stops, the record stops

My love is on the silver screen
The brightest star I've ever seen
She takes me to a better place
She dances like I can't believe

And it's hard to show
That every day feels like a dream
I'll give my world
To keep that girl right next to me

"'Cause I thought you'd see the real me
Adam, it had nothing to do with you
I like you
You... like me?
Stop it, we're missing the movie"

Oh, darling, won't you believe me?
I love you 'til the record stops, the record stops
Oh, darling, won't you believe me?
I love you 'til the record stops, the record stops
Oh, darling, darling
Now darling, darling
Darling, darling
I love you 'til the record stops, the record stops
