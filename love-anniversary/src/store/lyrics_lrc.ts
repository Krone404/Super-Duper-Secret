[00:01.86]"I can't believe how happy I am
[00:05.57]I think I was embarrassing with them, wasn't I?
[00:18.27]So does that mean you didn't really like all the champagne?
[00:21.23]No, I did too much"
[00:43.00]My love's on the silver screen
[00:47.33]She's always playing make-believe
[00:51.90]And she's got emerald eyes
[00:56.12]That let me know just what she needs
[00:59.63]It's hard to show
[01:04.04]Exactly what she means to me
[01:08.54]I'll give my world
[01:13.11]A girl like that don't come for free
[01:34.76]Oh, darling, won't you believe me?

[01:52.77]Oh, darling, darling
[01:56.75]Now darling, darling
[02:01.68]Darling, darling
[02:05.74]I love you 'til the record stops, the record stops
[02:09.82]My love is on the silver screen
[02:14.32]The brightest star I've ever seen
[02:18.69]She takes me to a better place
[02:23.27]She dances like I can't believe
[02:26.94]And it's hard to show
[02:31.76]That every day feels like a dream
[02:35.65]I'll give my world
[02:40.14]To keep that girl right next to me
[02:46.30]"Cause I thought you'd see the real me
[02:50.56]Adam, it had nothing to do with you
[02:53.91]I like you
[02:56.67]You... like me?
[02:59.33]Stop it, we're missing the movie"
[03:02.38]Oh, darling, won't you believe me?
[03:06.71]I love you 'til the record stops, the record stops
[03:11.04]Oh, darling, won't you believe me?
[03:15.42]I love you 'til the record stops, the record stops
[03:19.61]Oh, darling, darling
[03:24.06]Now darling, darling
[03:28.76]Darling, darling
